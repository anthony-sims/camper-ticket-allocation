<h1>The Church of Belligerence</h1>
<p>Salutations, cunt!</p>
<p>
    We are rapidly approaching the start of Blazing Swan 2024!
    As such we have a few items to go over to make sure everything runs as best as it can.
</p>
<h2>!! CAMP DUES !!</h2>
<p>
    If you have not already, please pay these. It is $50 and goes toward the running of the camp.
    If you are in a position where monetary contributions are not possible please reach out. <br>
    These are payable to:
    <pre>
        Name: Church of Belligerence 
        BSB 066-528 
        acc number: 10412166
    </pre>
</p>
<h2>Water</h2>
<p>
    Reminder that you need to be self-reliant and should be bringing enough water to survive the full extent of your stay.
    We are also asking each of you to donate <b>10L</b> of water (these can be purchased at supermarkets for around $5).
    This water is used for the bar and other various camp supplies.
</p>
<h2>Meals</h2>
<p>
    There will be dinner service available to all campers but as always, DO NOT rely on this and make sure you have enough food for the duration of the event.
</p>
<h2>Diet</h2>
<p>
    For the purposes of feeding your greedy mouths correctly, please fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/jHvG4uDnsPeX6qNU8">this form</a>
    to list your allergies and dietary requirements. <b>NOTE:</b> all meals will be vegan at a minimum.
</p>
<h2>Participate</h2>
<p>
    Please tell us if you have other ways you wish to contribute. Examples: 
    <ul>
        <li>DJ (even if you have never done it before),</li>
        <li>Live performance,</li>
        <li>Fet scenes.</li>
    </ul>
    Whatever it is, we will do our best to make it happen.
</p>
<h2>Rosters</h2>
<p>
    Rosters are being prepared and we will be assigning people to jobs. If there is a particular slot you don't want that's fine just inform me so we can swap shifts around. <br>
    The roster isn't strict on release we will accomodate your preferences.
</p>
<h2>Bar</h2>
<p>
    Easily the best part of what we do, being truly Belligerent working at the bar.
    If this is something that interests you, please email your RSA to <a href="mailto:belligerence@mail.com">belligerence@mail.com</a>.
</p>
<h2>Bible</h2>
<p>
    Every year we create a booklet of all our events and the centerfold is a collage of all members.
    Please send us (reach out on socials) a picture you would like included.
</p>
<h2>Final Update</h2>
<p>
    I will email and post to the chat again once the rosters are done. Please keep an eye out for this.
</p>
<p>Fuck off, <br>
Na–ò Daddy</p>
